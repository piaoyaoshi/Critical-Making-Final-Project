- Each button has differenct chances of triggering each light 
    - BUTTON 1: RED (2/3) ; YELLOW (1/3)
    - BUTTON 2: YELLOW (2/3); GREEN (1/3)
    - BUTTON 3: GREEN (2/3); RED (1/3) 

- Alan Algorithm is meant as a teaching tool. Itâ€™s really designed for people from about 16 years old to take a fun look at how they think about algorithms.
