GAME 1 - “TRAFFIC LIGHT MELEE!!!” (2 players):

1)    The goal of Traffic Light Melee is to beat your partner in a battle. This is a new twist on Rock Paper Scissors.
2)    In Traffic Light Melee, Green beats Red, Red beats Yellow, and Yellow beats Green.
3)    Each player must verbally announce which button the player intends to press before any player presses the button.
4)    Once each player has made this decision, they press that button.
5)    The colour that comes up is the player’s entry in the battle.
6)    Play up to a certain number of points or play best 2/3.
  Alternative 1: Remove one of the buttons from play.
  Alternative 2: Change up the rules so that different colours are now strong and weak against different colours. 
  
  
GAME 2 - “RED ALERT” (2+ players):
1)    The goal of Red Alert is to be the last player standing in a round of play.
2)    Players take turns pressing one of three buttons. When a player presses a button and the red light turns on, that player is out.
3)    Each round consists of Player 1 pressing a button, then Player 2 pressing a button. Before Player 1 presses a second button, Player 2 must press Player 2’s first button.
4)    A round is complete once (and if) each player presses all three buttons without getting a red light.
5)    In a round when Player 1 is going first and Player 1 gets a red light, Player 2 still needs to get a green or yellow light on her press.
6)    If Player 2 gets a red light, then Player 1 is not out and the game continues.
7)    A player may not press the same button twice before pressing all three buttons.
8)    Red Alert can be expanded to include as many players as desired.
  Alternative 1: the goal of the game can be to avoid a green light or a yellow light.
  Alternative 2: play cooperatively to see how far you and your friends can get without getting a red light.
